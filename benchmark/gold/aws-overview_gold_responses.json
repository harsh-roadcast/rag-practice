This allows enterprises, \nstart-ups, small and medium-sized businesses, and customers in the public sector to access the \nbuilding blocks they need to respond quickly to changing business requirements. This whitepaper \nprovides you with an overview of the beneﬁts of the AWS Cloud and introduces you to the services \nthat make up the platform. Introduction\nIn 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began oﬀering IT infrastructure services to businesses as web \nservices—now commonly known as cloud computing. One of the key beneﬁts of cloud computing \nis the opportunity to replace upfront capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs \nthat scale with your business. With the cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure \nservers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up \nhundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster. Today, AWS provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that \npowers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world. This video explores how millions of customers use AWS to take advantage of the eﬃciencies of \ncloud computing: What is AWS? | Amazon Web Services\nIntroduction 1"
